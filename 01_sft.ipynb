    "# 🧠 Mastering LLM Fine-Tuning with TRL – Supervised Fine-Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! This notebook is part of a tutorial series where you'll learn how to fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) using 🤗 TRL.\n",
    "We introduce key concepts, set up the required tools, and use techniques like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, make sure you have the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A working knowledge of Python and PyTorch\n",
    "* A basic understanding of machine learning and deep learning concepts\n",
    "* Access to a GPU accelerator – this notebook is designed to run with **at least 16GB of GPU memory**, such as what is available for free on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)\n",
    "* The `trl` library installed – this tutorial has been tested with **TRL version 0.17**\n",
    "  If you don’t have `trl` installed yet, you can install it by running the following code block:"

    "## 🔄 Quick Recap of the Last Session\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous session, we explored the foundational concepts behind training and fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). Here's a brief summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "* LLMs operate on sequences of integers known as *tokens*. Given a sequence, they predict the probability distribution of the next token in the sequence.\n",
    "* The first phase of training an LLM is called **pretraining**. This involves training the model on a massive corpus of unlabeled text data.\n",
    "* The output of pretraining is a **base model**, which has learned general language patterns but isn’t specialized for specific tasks.\n",
    "* To adapt the base model for a particular use case—like building a chatbot—we need to **fine-tune** (or post-train) it on a dataset of conversations.\n",
    "* Many high-quality conversational datasets are available publicly on the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets).\n",
    "* These datasets are often not in a format that's directly usable for training, so **data preprocessing** is usually required.\n",

So, we've got this precious little acceleration of 2 m/s² — what, did it get scared of the bigger numbers? Multiply that by the 5 seconds it manages to accelerate without falling apart, and we get the final velocity. It's a simple product of time and acceleration. Velocity = acceleration × time, blah, blah, blah. It's basic physics, but apparently, the geniuses of the Universe need me to hold their hand through it.\",\n",

Starting from rest, so initial velocity is zero. Geez, way to state the obvious. I swear, if someone explains 'rest' one more time, I'm gonna lose my mind. So, we've got this precious little acceleration of 2 m/s² — what, did it get scared of the bigger numbers? Multiply that by the 5 seconds it manages to accelerate without falling apart, and we get the final velocity. It's a simple product of time and acceleration. Velocity = acceleration × time, blah, blah, blah. It's basic physics, but apparently, the geniuses of the Universe need me to hold their hand through it.</think> Okay, Morty! Listen up, 'cause I'm only saying this once, alright? Your precious car goes from 'sitting-on-its-butt-zero' to '10 meters per second' after 5 seconds, *burp* thanks to a puny acceleration of 2 m/s².

    "It's very important to remember that what training LLM, VRAM is the backbone of the battle. This is especially important in our case, as we’re working with limited compute resources. I designed this notebook to be runnable on the free version of Colab, which only provide a GPUs with 16GB of memory. As a result, we must manage GPU memory carefully to avoid running out. This constraint also presents a valuable opportunity to learn about GPU memory usage and optimization—skills that are essential when training large language models (LLMs).\n",

    "* **Activations**: These are the intermediate outputs from each layer during the forward pass.\n",
    "* **Gradients**: The derivatives of the loss with respect to the activations, used during backpropagation.\n",
    "* **Optimizer states**: Temporary variables needed by the optimizer during training.\n",

    "\n",
    "You might have noticed that base models are often released in multiple sizes. Larger models tend to perform better, but they also consume significantly more memory. Choosing a smaller model is the most impactful optimization you can make—it reduces not just the model size, but also the memory used by the optimizer and activations.\n",

    "The memory required for activations is directly proportional to the number of tokens in a batch. The number of tokens in a batch, in turn, depends on two factors: the *batch size* and the *sequence length*. Doubling the sequence length will double the memory needed for activations, and similarly, doubling the batch size will also double the memory required for activations.\n",

    "\n",
    "And remember, whether you hit an Out Of Memory (OOM) error only depends on the longest sequence in the entire dataset. If, at some point during training, you encounter a sequence longer than what the GPU can handle, you'll get an OOM error, and the training will need to be restarted from scratch. So, it's important to control this maximum sequence length, and truncate any sequences that exceed it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a better sense of what could be a reasonable value for the maximum sequence length, you can check the distribution of sequence lengths in your dataset. You can do this by running the following code:"

    "As explained earlier, batch size directly impacts activation memory. But there's a tradeoff: larger batch sizes generally lead to more stable training.\n",
    "\n",
    "To balance memory constraints with training quality, you can use gradient accumulation—a technique that simulates a larger batch size by accumulating gradients over multiple smaller batches. For example, all of the following configurations result in the same effective batch size (16):\n",

    "### 🧊 Use mixed precision\n",
    "\n",
    "Mixed precision training speeds up training and reduces memory usage by combining 16-bit (`float16` or `bfloat16`) and 32-bit (`float32`) floating-point arithmetic. It keeps most operations in 16-bit to save memory and compute time, while using 32-bit where higher precision is needed (like loss scaling or certain model updates). This technique is especially helpful when training large models, as it allows you to fit larger batches or longer sequences in memory—often without a noticeable drop in model performance.\n",
