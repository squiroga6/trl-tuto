    "# 🧠 Mastering LLM Fine-Tuning with TRL – Supervised Fine-Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! This notebook is part of a tutorial series where you'll learn how to fine-tune Large Language Models (LLMs) using 🤗 TRL.\n",
    "We’ll introduce key concepts, set up the required tools, and prepare for techniques like Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, make sure you have the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A working knowledge of Python and PyTorch\n",
    "* A basic understanding of machine learning and deep learning concepts\n",
    "* Access to a GPU accelerator – this notebook is designed to run with **at least 16GB of GPU memory**, such as what is available for free on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)\n",
    "* The `trl` library installed – this tutorial has been tested with **TRL version 0.17**\n",
    "  If you don’t have `trl` installed yet, you can install it by running the following code block:"

    "## 🔄 Quick Recap of the Last Session\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous session, we explored the foundational concepts behind training and fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). Here's a brief summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "* LLMs operate on sequences of integers known as *tokens*. Given a sequence, they predict the probability distribution of the next token in the sequence.\n",
    "* The first phase of training an LLM is called **pretraining**. This involves training the model on a massive corpus of unlabeled text data.\n",
    "* The output of pretraining is a **base model**, which has learned general language patterns but isn’t specialized for specific tasks.\n",
    "* To adapt the base model for a particular use case—like building a chatbot—we need to **fine-tune** it on a dataset of conversations.\n",
    "* Many high-quality conversational datasets are available publicly on the [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets).\n",
    "* These datasets are often not in a format that's directly usable for training, so **data preprocessing** is usually required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we're on the same page, let's dive into the next session! First Let's load our base model and tokenizer. We'll be using `SmolLM2-360M`.\n"

This means we need to manage GPU memory carefully to avoid running out of it. It’s also a great opportunity to learn how GPU memory works and how to use it efficiently—something that’s absolutely critical when training large language models (LLMs).\n",

    "You might have noticed that base models are often released in multiple sizes. Larger models tend to perform better, but they also consume significantly more memory.
